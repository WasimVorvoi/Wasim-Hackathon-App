# Wasim-Hackathon-App

Under Development

This app is a GUI-based informatics tournament platform where students can register or log in to participate in coding challenges. It features two main tabs: one for accessing and submitting solutions to questions, and another for viewing a live leaderboard that shows rankings and points. Students upload their code files directly through the interface, and the system evaluates their submissions automatically. Admins can manage questions, adjust user scores, and receive real-time submission notifications. The platform uses UDP communication for lightweight, efficient updates between client and server.
